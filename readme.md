# PISA Dataset Visualization
## by Marc Angelo Acebedo


## Dataset

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge upon the end of their compulsory education, looking at how well-prepared they are for life after school. Around 510,000 students in [65 economies](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-2012-participants.htm) took part in this survey.

The full dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisa2012.csv.zip) and the explanation for each column can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisadict2012.csv).

The overall motivation for this project is to *explore what factors shape a student's self-esteem and academic performance*. To do this, I diverge on 2 different paths: examining both ***environmental*** and ***demographic*** variables.
